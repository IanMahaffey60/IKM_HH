Hydrology and Hydraulics (H&H) tools for Rational and TR-55 design methods. 

Long term goals: 

  1. Robust plugin for QGIS to be able to complete an entire H&H design for a development. 
      a. Hydrology design
      b. Storm drain design
      c. Detention/Retention design
      d. Rip Rap aprons and lining design
      e. Ability to add custom functions for various objects easily
      f. Automatic design methods (Change slope/diameter of pipes, automatically design pond outlets, channel geometry)
      
  2. Multitude of options for inputting data from different sources, and exporting to different formats.
      a. eg. Utilizing a Autodesk Stage Storage Report for pond parameters.
      b. eg. Inputting external hydrographs/rating curves for any H&H object.
      c. eg. Being utilized as intermediary steps for other softwares, such as HEC-HMS, HEC-RAS, SWMM, etc.
